Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.

Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).

Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.

TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.

REDALERT/GLOBALS.CPP,fc5cd5a,PG-SteveT,"Command & Conquer Remastered post-launch patch  Improvements to harvester resource finding logic.  Don't allow the Advanced Comm Center to be capturable in skirmish or multiplayer.  Increased failed pathfinding fudge factor.  Buildings accept the Guard command if they can attack.  Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.  Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.  Ignore mines when determining win conditions.  Fixed river passability in Blue Lakes.",133,133,PG-SteveT,03416d2,1,2020-06-22 16:43:21,2020-05-27 19:16:20

Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.

Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.  Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.

REDALERT/OBJECT.CPP,fc5cd5a,PG-SteveT,"Command & Conquer Remastered post-launch patch  Improvements to harvester resource finding logic.  Don't allow the Advanced Comm Center to be capturable in skirmish or multiplayer.  Increased failed pathfinding fudge factor.  Buildings accept the Guard command if they can attack.  Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.  Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.  Ignore mines when determining win conditions.  Fixed river passability in Blue Lakes.",2290,2290,,,1,2020-06-22 16:43:21,

Don't allow the Advanced Comm Center to be capturable in skirmish or multiplayer.  Increased failed pathfinding fudge factor.  Buildings accept the Guard command if they can attack.  Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.

Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.

Don't allow the Advanced Comm Center to be capturable in skirmish or multiplayer.  Increased failed pathfinding fudge factor.  Buildings accept the Guard command if they can attack.  Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.  Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.

Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.

Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).

Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.  Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.

TIBERIANDAWN/OVERLAY.CPP,fc5cd5a,PG-SteveT,"Command & Conquer Remastered post-launch patch  Improvements to harvester resource finding logic.  Don't allow the Advanced Comm Center to be capturable in skirmish or multiplayer.  Increased failed pathfinding fudge factor.  Buildings accept the Guard command if they can attack.  Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.  Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.  Ignore mines when determining win conditions.  Fixed river passability in Blue Lakes.",312,313,PG-SteveT,03416d2,1,2020-06-22 16:43:21,2020-05-27 19:16:20

Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.  Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.  Ignore mines when determining win conditions.  Fixed river passability in Blue Lakes.",599,603,,,1,2020-06-22 16:43:21,

TIBERIANDAWN/DLLInterface.cpp,fc5cd5a,PG-SteveT,"Command & Conquer Remastered post-launch patch  Improvements to harvester resource finding logic.  Don't allow the Advanced Comm Center to be capturable in skirmish or multiplayer.  Increased failed pathfinding fudge factor.  Buildings accept the Guard command if they can attack.  Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.  Don't debug reveal legacy rendering when a player is defeated.  Fixed crash when loading saves of custom campaign maps.  Reset harvester archived target when given a direct harvest order.  Prevent NOD cargo planes from being force attacked.  Fixed unit selection on load.  Migrated queued repair pad functionality from RA to TD.  Randomly animate infantry in area guard mode.  Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.

Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).

TIBERIANDAWN/UNIT.CPP,fc5cd5a,PG-SteveT,"Command & Conquer Remastered post-launch patch  Improvements to harvester resource finding logic.  Don't allow the Advanced Comm Center to be capturable in skirmish or multiplayer.  Increased failed pathfinding fudge factor.  Buildings accept the Guard command if they can attack.  Don't allow force capturing of ally structures.  Fixes for laser Orcas in S3cr3t M1ss10n. Properly restore them after save. Reset Orcas after loads.  Fixed flag animation rendering in CTF.  Potentially fix a crash if aircraft are destroyed outside the map bounds.  Fixed legacy Obelisk line rendering.  Fix out-of-bounds crash in TD; issue was already fixed in RA.  Disable capture flag on Commandos.  Drop the flag when entering the limbo state.  Fixed end game race condition, winning team ID is always sent before individual player win/lose messages.  Fixed Chan spawn on SCB10EA.  Don't show enter cursor for enemy units on refineries and repair pads.  Changing right-click support for first put building on hold, and then subsequenct right-clicks to decrement that queue count for 1x or 5x; Then, 1x or 5x Left click will resume from hold.

Fixed crash accessing inactive objects.  Added some walls in SCG08EB to prevent civilians from killing themselves.  TD + RA: Audio: Overiding ""Our base is under attack"" cooldown timing from legacy from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, so it will be heard 4x as often.  Fixed adjacent cell out-of-bounds crash issues.  Kill player on disconnect  Fixed and improved build time calculations to be consistent between TD and RA.  Don't show health bars for cloaked Stealth Tanks in the legacy renderer.  Fix selection of individual control groups after mixed selection.  More adjustments to SCG08EB; switch C7 to C5, and add civilian AI to avoid Tiberium.  Extra safety checks for units that have no weapons and aircraft that can't hunt.  Fix loading of multiple infantry onto an APC.  Additional safety checks for invalid coordinates.  Prevent units from being instantly repaired.  Fix map passability.  Fail Allied mission 5B if the spy re-boards the starting transport (matches 5A and 5C behavior).  Fixed multiplayer formation move causing units to move at light speed.  Ignore movement destination checks if a unit is part of a mission-driven team.  Fix buffer overrun crash.
