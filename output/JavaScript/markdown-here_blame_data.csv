This caused Thunderbird to not load the overlay in Thunderbird, which prevented it from being present in the message window.  To help mitigate this in the future, to some degree, the `i18n.js` script makes sure that all English strings are present in the other languages when creating the the .properties and .dtd files.

src/common/highlightjs/styles/dark.css,54fb24b,Adam Pritchard,"Fix #524 and #526: Broken in non-English Thunderbird  A string added in the Firefox 60 fix wasn't copied to the non-English `messages.json` files, which meant that it wasn't in the non-English `strings.properties` and `string.dtd` files. This caused Thunderbird to not load the overlay in Thunderbird, which prevented it from being present in the message window.  To help mitigate this in the future, to some degree, the `i18n.js` script makes sure that all English strings are present in the other languages when creating the the .properties and .dtd files. But I still have to remember to run that script.",1,1,Adam Pritchard,ea3387a,1,2018-09-30 00:54:00,2014-08-30 01:26:17

This caused Thunderbird to not load the overlay in Thunderbird, which prevented it from being present in the message window.  To help mitigate this in the future, to some degree, the `i18n.js` script makes sure that all English strings are present in the other languages when creating the the .properties and .dtd files.

src/firefox/chrome/content/ff-overlay.js,fc999a3,Adam Pritchard,"Fixed bug: In Firefox (and in Chrome, in theory, but I couldn't make it happen), full-message reverting could fail (instead double-render) if the cursor were outside the rendered block (i.e., at the very beginning, before the wrapper div). This fix involved making full-message render less of a special case: now, if there's no selection, the entire focused element contents are selected. This has a behavioural side-effect that is probably good: It's now impossible to double-render something; if the user renders a portion, and then tries to render the whole, they will instead revert the portion. This may be slightly confusing, but it's better than the destructiveness of double-rendering.",259,259,,,1,2012-05-31 22:06:18,

src/firefox/chrome/content/ff-overlay.js,fc999a3,Adam Pritchard,"Fixed bug: In Firefox (and in Chrome, in theory, but I couldn't make it happen), full-message reverting could fail (instead double-render) if the cursor were outside the rendered block (i.e., at the very beginning, before the wrapper div). This fix involved making full-message render less of a special case: now, if there's no selection, the entire focused element contents are selected. This has a behavioural side-effect that is probably good: It's now impossible to double-render something; if the user renders a portion, and then tries to render the whole, they will instead revert the portion. This may be slightly confusing, but it's better than the destructiveness of double-rendering.",499,499,,,1,2012-05-31 22:06:18,

This fix involved making full-message render less of a special case: now, if there's no selection, the entire focused element contents are selected. This has a behavioural side-effect that is probably good: It's now impossible to double-render something; if the user renders a portion, and then tries to render the whole, they will instead revert the portion. This may be slightly confusing, but it's better than the destructiveness of double-rendering.",55,57,,,1,2012-05-31 22:06:18,

This fix involved making full-message render less of a special case: now, if there's no selection, the entire focused element contents are selected. This has a behavioural side-effect that is probably good: It's now impossible to double-render something; if the user renders a portion, and then tries to render the whole, they will instead revert the portion.
