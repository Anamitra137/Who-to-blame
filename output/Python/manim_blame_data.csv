manimlib/mobject/changing.py,96d44bd,Grant Sanderson,"Video work (#2284)  * Comment tweak  * Directly print traceback  Since the shell.showtraceback is giving some issues  * Make InteracrtiveSceneEmbed into a class  This way it can keep track of it's internal shell; use of get_ipython has a finicky relationship with reloading.  * Move remaining checkpoint_paste logic into scene_embed.py  This involved making a few context managers for Scene: temp_record, temp_skip, temp_progress_bar, which seem useful in and of themselves.  * Change null key to be the empty string  * Ensure temporary svg paths for Text are deleted  * Remove unused dict_ops.py functions  * Remove break_into_partial_movies from file_writer configuration  * Rewrite guarantee_existence using Path  * Clean up SceneFileWriter  It had a number of vestigial functions no longer used, and some setup that could be made more organized.  * Remove --save_pngs CLI arg (which did nothing)  * Add --subdivide CLI arg  * Remove add_extension_if_not_present  * Remove get_sorted_integer_files  * Have find_file return Path  * Minor clean up  * Clean up num_tex_symbols  * Fix find_file  * Minor cleanup for extract_scene.py  * Add preview_frame_while_skipping option to scene config  * Use shell.showtraceback function  * Move keybindings to config, instead of in-place constants  * Replace DEGREES -> DEG  * Add arg to clear the cache  * Separate out full_tex_to_svg from tex_to_svg  And only cache to disk the results of full_tex_to_svg.  Otherwise, making edits to the tex_templates would not show up without clearing the cache.  * Bug fix in handling BlankScene  * Make checkpoint_states an instance variable of CheckpointManager  As per https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues/2272  * Move resizing out of Window.focus, and into Window.init_for_scene  * Make default output directory ""."" instead of """"  To address https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues/2261  * Remove input_file_path arg from SceneFileWriter  * Use Dict syntax in place of dict for config more consistently across config.py  * Simplify get_output_directory  * Swap order of preamble and additional preamble  * Minor stylistic tweak  * Have UnitInterval pass on kwargs to NumberLine  * Add simple get_dist function  * Have TracedPath always update to the stroke configuration passed in  * Have Mobject.match_points apply to all parts of data in pointlike_data_key  * Always call Mobject.update upon adding an updater  * Add Surface.uv_to_point  * Make sure Surface.set_opacity takes in a recurse option  * Update num_tex_symbols to account for \{ and \}",115,115,Grant Sanderson,4223bb6,1,2024-12-26 17:35:34,2024-08-06 15:23:46

But the existing solution was flimsy anyway, and caused annoying issues with singularity points.  * Have density of anchor points on arcs depend on arc length  * Allow for specifying true normals and orientation of Sphere  * Change miter threshold on stroke shader  * Add get_start_and_end to DashedLine  * Add min_total_width option to DecimalNumber  * Have BackgroundRectangle.set_style absorb (and ignore) added configuration  Note, this feels suboptimal  * Add LineBrace  * Update font_size adjustment in Tex",604,606,Grant Sanderson,744e695,0,2025-02-26 15:52:59,2024-12-12 16:39:54

Otherwise, making edits to the tex_templates would not show up without clearing the cache.  * Bug fix in handling BlankScene  * Make checkpoint_states an instance variable of CheckpointManager  As per https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues/2272  * Move resizing out of Window.focus, and into Window.init_for_scene  * Make default output directory ""."" instead of """"  To address https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues/2261  * Remove input_file_path arg from SceneFileWriter  * Use Dict syntax in place of dict for config more consistently across config.py  * Simplify get_output_directory  * Swap order of preamble and additional preamble  * Minor stylistic tweak  * Have UnitInterval pass on kwargs to NumberLine  * Add simple get_dist function  * Have TracedPath always update to the stroke configuration passed in  * Have Mobject.match_points apply to all parts of data in pointlike_data_key  * Always call Mobject.update upon adding an updater  * Add Surface.uv_to_point  * Make sure Surface.set_opacity takes in a recurse option  * Update num_tex_symbols to account for \{ and \}",845,845,Grant Sanderson,d5c36de,1,2024-12-26 17:35:34,2024-12-11 01:23:15

Otherwise, making edits to the tex_templates would not show up without clearing the cache.  * Bug fix in handling BlankScene  * Make checkpoint_states an instance variable of CheckpointManager  As per https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues/2272  * Move resizing out of Window.focus, and into Window.init_for_scene  * Make default output directory ""."" instead of """"  To address https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues/2261  * Remove input_file_path arg from SceneFileWriter  * Use Dict syntax in place of dict for config more consistently across config.py  * Simplify get_output_directory  * Swap order of preamble and additional preamble  * Minor stylistic tweak  * Have UnitInterval pass on kwargs to NumberLine  * Add simple get_dist function  * Have TracedPath always update to the stroke configuration passed in  * Have Mobject.match_points apply to all parts of data in pointlike_data_key  * Always call Mobject.update upon adding an updater  * Add Surface.uv_to_point  * Make sure Surface.set_opacity takes in a recurse option  * Update num_tex_symbols to account for \{ and \}",51,54,Grant Sanderson,13d4ab1,1,2024-12-26 17:35:34,2023-08-16 03:40:24
